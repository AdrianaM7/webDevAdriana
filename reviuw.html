        <h1> First, I have made a plan of my web page using draw.io 
            and later to design my web page using Visual Studio Code, 
            (css and htlm). I downloaded the files using github, 
            but my website was not ok. I have had a lot of trouble 
            using Visual Studio Code. I have not used Trello for website
            to plan my tasks. My website did not turn out the way 
            I wanted, but I'm still learning how to improve. I have not used 
            many functions and have created a minimalist website. 
            I would like to change some photos and put more texts.
            I can always be more efficient when creating my website because 
            you always learn new tools. I think if I had worked in a more productive 
            serious team and had had the opportunity to learn from 
            my colleagues. Next time I will be use trello.
